//! Utility library for working with ```cli``` output ergonomically.
//!
//! This is not a logging alternative, it's intended to produce output for end user consumption.
//!
//! It handles three levels of verbosity that can be set dynamically at runtime:
//!
//! * Quite - no output
//! * Terse - used to provide minimal user output
//! * Verbose - used to provide elaborated and/or additional user output
//!
//! Additionally, this library provides conditionally compiled debugging output intended to be
//! used during application development.
//!
//! All other debugging and telemetry output is most likely better served with a logging library.
//!
//! # Roadmap
//!
//! * [x] ```debug!``` macro
//! * [ ] ```Verbosity``` reporting level functionality
//! * [ ] ```report!``` macro
//!
//! # Roadmap - Â¿ Extra Credit ?
//!
//! * [ ] handle ```Option<T>``` expressions in addition to ```Result<T,E>```
//!       conditional expressions
